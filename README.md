# cinema

Apparently you can't play Netflix or even Youtube in a Raspberry Pi running regular raspbian.
Since my Pi is hooked to my TV and I want to watch stuff, I decided to make a program to give a Cinema experience.

`Cinema` is a webserver that serves a list of your movies. Use your smartphone to select one and click "play".
The program automagically finds subtitles and starts playing the movie, no TV interaction required.
